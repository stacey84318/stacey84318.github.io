    <h1>Segway'n USA</h1>
    <h3>Documenting my trip <br>around the US on my very own Segway!</h3>
    <h2>August 20, 2012</h2>
    <p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:
        <ul>
            <li>Walla Walla</li>
            <li> WA</li>
            <li> Magic City</li>
            <li> ID</li>
            <li> Bountiful</li>
            <li> UT</li>>
            <li>Last Chance</li>
            <li>CO</li>
            <li>Truth</li>
            <li> Consequences</li>
            <li> NM</li>
            <li> Why</li>
            <li> AZ</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>July 14, 2012</h2>
    <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
        <q>Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity.</q>
        I definitely won't be passing any cars.
    </p>
    <h2>June 2, 2012</h2>
    <p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
        <ol>
            <li> cellphone</li>
            <li> iPod</li>
            <li>digital camera</li>
            <li>a protein bar</li>
        </ol> Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said,
        <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
